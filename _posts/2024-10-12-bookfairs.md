Buying books from book fairs is one of my favorite activities. I almost
definitely go if the event is within 30 minutes drive. 

This is what I got from the recent one[^1]. Actually, yesterday and today. Yes,
I went twice.

It cost a bit over $100. And you would need to pay at least five times that to
buy new ones. Quite a bargain.

If you are lucky, you can find good books that are not available online or would
be much more expensive - like the ones blow I acquired before.

Those are jewelry.

Everyone has their own taste or preference about what makes a good book. The
publisher is one factor. For classic ones, credible publishers include Penguin,
Vintage, and Modern Library.

But, some of my favorite books are self-published. For example, [cant't hurt
me](https://www.amazon.com.au/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your/dp/1544512279).

In comprision, authors are more reliable indicator of good books. What are a
good authors depend on the topic you are intrested in. But it is reansonble to
assume you will want to read a physics book from a physicist and a psychological
book from a psychologist. Once you find the trusted ones, the authors or book
recommended or referenced by him/her are the ones you should look into. That is
how you expand your collection of favorite authors and books.

Finding books you like or can benefit from is one of the luckiest things you can
have in life. 

Wish you good luck!
