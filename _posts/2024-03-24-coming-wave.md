This is my note of book [The coming wave](https://amzn.asia/d/gdaf93m), written by Mustafa Suleyman, [newly appointed CEO of Microsoft AI](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/03/19/mustafa-suleyman-deepmind-and-inflection-co-founder-joins-microsoft-to-lead-copilot/)[^1].

## Content

The key idea of the book can be summarized as:

> Revolutionary technology always proliferates. Containment of AI seems impossible. However, uncontrolled AI may spell the end of human civilization. Thus, we must take actions to contain AI.

These four sentences above also serve as the summary of the four sections of the book.

The first section lays the foundation that revolutionary technology diffuses. It will eventually permeate society and bring about societal change. Examples include the steam engine, internet, smartphones, and now, AI.

The second section explains why AI is not containable.

First, because of its characteristics:

- Asymmetric power: 100x productivity boost, redefining what is useful and powerful, and redistribution of power.
- Evolves fast, permeating everywhere, akin to the Internet and social media.
- Multi-purpose and general-use, akin to electricity.
- Possesses partial understanding while autonomous, which is particularly concerning.

Second, because of the irresistible incentive:

- National strategy intensifies due to geopolitical competition, especially between the US and China.
- Huge profits are pursued by companies and individuals.
- Individual (entrepreneurs and academies) drive to make a mark in this historic moment.
- The open nature of academia and the tendency towards open software will further accelerate rapid evolution.

The logic flows well to this point.

The third section of this book is less coherent, imho. It starts with the author's disappointing experience in nonprofit and government jobs. Then it discusses how nation-states are fragile and unstable due to erosion of trust, polarization, pandemic, and war. The forthcoming wave of AI will further amplify this fragility, with examples such as AI-powered ransomware, robots armed with guns, deepfakes, and AI Machiavellis.

The book ends with 10 recommendations for the containment of AI. Regardless of what the recommendations are, up to this point, I'm convinced that the regulation of AI is necessary and vital.

## Style

Overall, I quite enjoyed the book. The prose style is fluid, concise, straight to the point, and with little pretense. The writing is engaging and conversational. The author shows dexterity in explaining things and concepts. He likes to use analogies with known events or objects[^1]. It is also evident that the author is quite versatile in history. I have noticed lots of people talking about the risk of AI, including Elon Musk and Geoffrey Hinton. But no one is as eloquent as Mustafa is in this book. Perhaps that is one of the reasons he can be CEO of Microfware AI.

[^1]: For example, a car seat belt is a type of safety mechanism to reduce the consequences of a car accident. Hence,it makes sense to have a safety mechanism to reduce the potential harmful impact of AI. This seemingly native analogy makes concrete what safety means for AI and why it is necessary.
