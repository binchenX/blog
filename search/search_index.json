It hints at a sense of revenge from China, akin to a once-bullied child seeking retaliation when they become as strong as their former perpetrator.</p> <p>I learned about the Opium War and the invasion of the West in 1840-1940 from my early school years. The period was filled with stories of indemnities, territorial cessions, and loss of sovereignty. Hundreds of Billions of dollars were paid. Taiwan and Hong Kong were taken away, and Westerners enjoyed special privileges in Chinese lands. It was a situation no single country would want to be in or should be in.</p> <p>In my youth, I wasn't particularly interested in this history and didn't pay much attention to it. After all, those events happened 100 years ago.</p> <p>However, recent wars between Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Palestine, made me think: What caused the bloodshed? Who is right? What is justice? I started to read a few history books, watch YouTube, and listen to podcasts about topics that interest me.</p> <p>Amid the ongoing competition between China and the West, I became increasingly interested in knowing more about the period when China was weak. I wanted to learn more about what happened, why it happened, what the consequences were, and what it tells us about the reality of the world and what we can learn from it.</p>"},{"location":"opiumwar/#books","title":"Books","text":"<p>Here are the main books I have read on this topic:</p> <ul> <li>World Order by Henry Kissinger</li> <li>On China by Henry Kissinger</li> <li>From Third World to First, Lee Kuan Yew</li> <li>On Serach of Morden china by Jonathan D.

It stemmed from Britain's increasing demand for Chinese goods and the trade imbalance that ensued. To address this, Britain began exporting opium from India to China, despite the Chinese government's attempts to ban the drug due to its harmful effects. The major development occurred when the Chinese government seized and destroyed British opium shipments, leading to British retaliation and the outbreak of hostilities. The conflict concluded with the signing of the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, which forced China to cede Hong Kong to Britain, open several treaty ports to foreign trade, grant extraterritorial rights to British citizens, and pay a large indemnity to Britain.</p>"},{"location":"opiumwar/#consequences","title":"Consequences","text":"<p>The Opium War had significant consequences for China, marking the beginning of a period of foreign intervention and encroachment on Chinese sovereignty.
