# Century of Humiliation of China

Western media often cite the 'Century of Humiliation' to explain China's
increasing assertiveness towards the West. It hints at a sense of revenge from
China, akin to a once-bullied child seeking retaliation when they become as
strong as their former perpetrator.

I learned about the Opium War and the invasion of the West in 1840-1940 from my
early school years. The period was filled with stories of
[indemnities](#indemnity), [territorial
cessions](#territorial-cessions-and-force-ports-open-for-trading), and loss of
sovereignty. Hundreds of Billions of dollars were paid. Taiwan and Hong Kong
were taken away, and Westerners enjoyed special privileges in Chinese lands. It
was a situation no single country would want to be in or should be in.

In my youth, I wasn't particularly interested in this history and didn't pay
much attention to it. After all, those events happened 100 years ago.

However, recent wars between Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Palestine, made me
think: What caused the bloodshed? Who is right? What is justice? I started to
read a few history books, watch YouTube, and listen to podcasts about topics
that interest me.

Amid the ongoing competition between China and the West, I became increasingly
interested in knowing more about the period when China was weak. I wanted to
learn more about what happened, why it happened, what the consequences were, and
what it tells us about the reality of the world and what we can learn from it.

## Centry of Huminnation for China

We can break this peroid in four phases:

- 1837 - 1861: Opium Wars: Arrogant, ignorant and weak China was defeated by Britain, twice.
- 1861 - 1888: A period to take a break and attempt to strengthen itself.
- 1895       : First Sino-Japanese War and beyond: Defeated by its neighbor and Western powers.
- 1938 - 1945: Second Sino-Japanese War, part of the Second World War.

Here is the story in twitter format:

- China had enjoyed preeminence in the world.
- However, western countries were becoming increasingly strong militarily thanks to enlightenment, scientific, and industrial revolutions.
- China, being closed off and unaware of the changing world, still clung to the illusion of itself being the alpha and center of the world.
- Driven by economic interests, Britain began importing opium to China through a government-backed company, effectively making Britain a state drug dealer.
- China started cracking down on the drug trade.
- However, backed by powerful military capabilities, Britain defeated China, and China lost.
- But China didn't learn from this experience.
- Twenty years later, Britain desired more from China and beat China once again, with China losing again.
- This time, China woke up and wanted to learn to defend itself and possibly seek revenge.
- However, the learning was not effective. This was manifested in the failure of the 1895 Sino-Japan war. Japan, once a country paying tribute to China, defeated China. This was the final blow to China's sense of superiority.
- Encouraged by China's defeat to Japan, more countries came in 1900 and took part in dividing China.

## Opium Wars

Instead of summary what I read and think. I will defer to chatgpt. I asked
following questions and fact check the facts with the book I read. For
subjective opinion, I'm also satisfied and inline with chatgp's answer. So I
will use it in full as an co-writer.

### What Happened?

The Opium War occurred between 1839 and 1842 and involved a conflict between China and Britain. It stemmed from Britain's increasing demand for Chinese goods and the trade imbalance that ensued. To address this, Britain began exporting opium from India to China, despite the Chinese government's attempts to ban the drug due to its harmful effects. The major development occurred when the Chinese government seized and destroyed British opium shipments, leading to British retaliation and the outbreak of hostilities. The conflict concluded with the signing of the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, which forced China to cede Hong Kong to Britain, open several treaty ports to foreign trade, grant extraterritorial rights to British citizens, and pay a large indemnity to Britain.

### Consequences

The Opium War had significant consequences for China, marking the beginning of a period of foreign intervention and encroachment on Chinese sovereignty. It led to territorial concessions, economic exploitation, and social upheaval, often referred to as the "Century of Humiliation." Additionally, the Opium War exposed weaknesses in China's military and governance systems, highlighting the urgent need for modernization and reform.

### What Does This Incident Tell Us About the Reality of the World in Terms of Justice and Power?

The Opium War underscores the imbalance of power and the absence of justice in the international system during the 19th century. It demonstrates how powerful nations could exploit weaker states for their economic interests and exert dominance through military force. The unequal treaties imposed on China reflect a system of international relations characterized by coercion rather than fairness or mutual respect.

### How Is the Situation Different Nowadays?

In contemporary times, the balance of power has shifted, with China emerging as a major global player. Unlike during the Opium War era, China now possesses significant economic and military capabilities, allowing it to assert its interests on the world stage. Additionally, the international community has evolved, with greater emphasis placed on multilateralism, diplomacy, and respect for sovereignty. However, power dynamics and challenges related to justice and fairness still persist in the global arena.

### How Could China Have Done Better?

In hindsight, China could have taken several steps to better protect its interests and sovereignty during the Opium War. These include implementing more effective measures to regulate trade and control the influx of opium, strengthening its military capabilities, pursuing diplomatic solutions to resolve conflicts, and undertaking comprehensive reforms to modernize its institutions and adapt to the changing global landscape. By doing so, China could have potentially mitigated the adverse consequences of foreign intervention and maintained its sovereignty more effectively.
